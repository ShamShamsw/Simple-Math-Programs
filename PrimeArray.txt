# Sudocode
# 1. Generate a list of 25 random numbers between 0 and 100
# 2. Loop through the list
# 3. Check if the number is prime
# 4. Print the result
# 5. Repeat for all numbers in the list
# 6. End

# Additionally this code could be refined to only check if and print if the number is prime, and not print if it is not prime.
# Or vise versa.
# This could be done by removing the else statement code block
