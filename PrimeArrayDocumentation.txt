# This program generates a list of 25 random numbers between 0 and 100 and checks if each number is prime or not.
# To recap prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
# This program takes the numbers in the list and checks if they are prime or not.
# If the number is prime it will print that the number is prime.
# If the number is not prime it will print that the number is not prime.

# Import for random number generation
#import random

#    for i in range(2, n):
#        if n % i == 0:
#            return False
#    return True

#def main():
